^c^s show subtree

- redo parser
 - test parser push/pop
  - fill buf with results
   - need function to fill a val
 - validation unit test for mixed with error

 - redo structs to include hash of 8 slots
 - APIs for callback or object
  - also callback for multi-json
 - validator with nil callbacks

- make sure follow works
- allow catchup on stream parser if with callbacks
 - make error callbacks but also ojcVal callbacks, maybe the same if start is bad
 - if invalid character keep reading until the start of something
  - best effort if not sure, worse case is bogus results
  - catchup mode function
   - read until an close - white space - open is hit
    - } {    ][    }[   ] {


- reader_next_non_white(ojcErr err, Reader reader)
 - ignore ANSI/VT100 escape sequences
  - will need to parse each code to determine length

- multiple threads
 - could have free thread to put nodes back in cache

- TBD stream write functions someday
