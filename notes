- compare enhancement
 - option to take any file and iterations


- article
 - x vs OjC
 - cast as a set of field events
  - start as boxing but then nix that idea as too confrontational
  - start with goodwill that it is a competition but friendly
 - explain the competitors
  - team size, participants and support
   - oj
    - support 1
    - several competitors
     - some sitting idle due to no competition in write and building events
     - validator
     - string parser
     - 2 callback parsers
   - simdjson
    - huge support team of 63
    - two competitors
     - parser
     - multiple file

  - events
   - validate
    - ca
    - mesh (borrowed from simdjson site, not used but shows how close the runners are)
   - parse string
   - multi json file parsing
    - large file are more often multiple json
    - normally no restrictions on entries but simdjson is not able to handle anything but one per line
     - want the games to continue so rules were changed to allow limited or restricted file format
    - 3 level of size/length
     - 1GB for small files (1 mile, 1500)
     - 10 for still fit in memory (stadium, cross country, 10K)
     - 20 for too much for memory but not crazy long (marathon or maybe half, not an ultra)
    - two types (straight run vs hurdles or steeple chase)
     - light is pretty much flat out with only counting entries
     - heavy is additional load for handling processing of each entry
      - simple busy loop for 8 usec (rough average parse time)
   - files are all generated log files (graphql query and response)
   - build - cancelled but explain
   - write/format - cancelled but explain

 - maybe event team member match to function(s)

 - anouncers
  - pat and chris (gender neutral)
