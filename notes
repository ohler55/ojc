- make sure follow works
- allow catchup on stream parser if with callbacks
 - make error callbacks but also ojcVal callbacks, maybe the same if start is bad
 - if invalid character keep reading until the start of something
  - best effort if not sure, worse case is bogus results
  - catchup mode function
   - read until an close - white space - open is hit
    - } {    ][    }[   ] {


- reader_next_non_white(ojcErr err, Reader reader) 
 - ignore ANSI/VT100 escape sequences
  - will need to parse each code to determine length

- multiple threads
 - could have free thread to put nodes back in cache

- TBD stream write functions someday
